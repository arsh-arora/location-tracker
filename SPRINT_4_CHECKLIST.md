## ðŸŽ¯ Key Deliverables Completed

1. **SyncWorker**: Background worker for automated data synchronization
2. **API Integration**: Complete REST API service with proper error handling
3. **Batch Processing**: Efficient location sync with 500-item batches
4. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed network operations
5. **Periodic Scheduling**: Automated sync every 15 minutes with constraints
6. **Offline Queuing**: Robust offline storage with sync status tracking
7. **Network Management**: Proper HTTP client configuration with timeouts

## ðŸ“ˆ Technical Achievements

- **Background Sync**: WorkManager integration with Hilt dependency injection
- **Batch Efficiency**: 500-location batches for optimal network usage
- **Error Recovery**: 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff policy
- **Network Constraints**: Sync only when connected with battery optimization
- **Data Integrity**: Upload status tracking prevents duplicate syncs
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status handling
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of sync, network, and data layers

## ðŸš€ Ready for Sprint 5

Sprint 4 provides robust offline capabilities for implementing:
- Anti-spoofing implementation with evidence collection
- Mock location detection and validation
- Dual-fix consistency checks
- Advanced security measures

All Sprint 4 objectives have been successfully completed! âœ…

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Sync Architecture
- **SyncWorker**: Hilt-injected worker running every 15 minutes
- **Batch Processing**: Locations synced in 500-item batches for efficiency
- **Individual Sync**: Punches synced individually with detailed error handling
- **Status Tracking**: Database flags prevent duplicate uploads

### Network Configuration
- **Timeouts**: 30-second connect/read/write timeouts
- **Logging**: Full HTTP body logging in debug, none in release
- **Base URL**: Configurable via BuildConfig.API_BASE_URL
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status code checking

### Retry Strategy
- **Max Attempts**: 3 retry attempts for failed syncs
- **Backoff Policy**: Exponential backoff starting at 5 minutes
- **Constraints**: Network connectivity required for sync operations
- **Battery Optimization**: Sync allowed even when battery is low

### Data Flow
1. Location/Punch data saved to database with `isUploaded = false`
2. SyncWorker runs every 15 minutes (or immediately when triggered)
3. Worker retrieves pending data from database
4. Data uploaded to server in batches/individually
5. Successful uploads marked with `isUploaded = true`
6. Failed uploads retry with exponential backoff

### WorkManager Configuration
- **Periodic Work**: 15-minute intervals with KEEP policy
- **Constraints**: CONNECTED network required
- **Unique Work**: Named workers prevent duplicate scheduling
- **Immediate Sync**: On-demand sync with REPLACE policy
