- Network state handling and retry logic
- WorkManager integration for background sync
- API integration for server communication

All Sprint 3 objectives have been successfully completed! âœ…

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Punch Flow
1. User taps punch button â†’ Loading state shown
2. PunchManager gets high-accuracy location (Priority.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
3. Location accuracy validated (must be â‰¤150m)
4. System searches for existing places within 220m radius
5. If no place found â†’ Create new place with calculated radius
6. If place found â†’ Use existing place
7. Create punch entity with location data and server distance
8. Save to database â†’ Show success with place info

### Place Detection Algorithm
- Search all active places within 220m radius using Haversine formula
- Select nearest place if multiple found
- Create new place if none found with radius = max(120m, accuracy + 40m)
- New places get "PENDING" status for server approval

### Navigation Structure
- **Home**: Dashboard with statistics and system status
- **Tracking**: Location service controls and real-time tracking
- **Punch**: Punch in/out functionality with place detection

### Database Queries
- Last punch retrieval for UI state
- Today's punches count for statistics
- Recent locations count for dashboard
- All queries use reactive Flow for real-time updates
